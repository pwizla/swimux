Swimux is a complete rewrite of my [Swimo](github.com/pwizla/swimo) budget web app, using the three main [Redux](http://redux.js.org/) principles (single source of truth, no mutations, pure functions).

This app was boostrapped with the npm package [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You might want to read more about it [here](./bootstrapped.md).
